With review of the [typegram](https://github.com/recoilme/tgram/) project code, it was discovered that multiple endpoints are vulnerable to CSRF. [More info about CSRF](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))

By default, "_Access-Control-Allow-Origin_" header set in _*_, what means Ajax can be used to perform malicious requests, like in [this](../delete.html) shitty snippet.
If own instance of typegram has inproper configs vulnerability can be executed.
[Typegram source](https://github.com/recoilme/tgram/blob/master/main.go#L186)

### Security suggestions:
- Replace vulnerable configuration with a more secure one.
- Vulnerable GET requests must be replaced with POST / PUT
- Need to add protection against CSRF attacks [(More Info)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
